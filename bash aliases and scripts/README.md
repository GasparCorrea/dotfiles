# About `new_c.sh` and `new_cpp.sh`

I made these scripts to save time when testing or coding small stuff in `C/C++`.

The script creates a folder with a given name, a basic `.c/.cpp` file with the same given name, and also a makefile to compile. 

Finally the script open `vim` to edit your file and start coding.

# About `rmd.sh`

With the help of `pandoc` and `lynx` you can read Markdown files in your terminal by given the path of your .md file as an argument.
