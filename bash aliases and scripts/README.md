# About `new_c.sh` and `new_cpp.sh`

I made these scripts to save time when testing or coding small stuff in `C/C++`, it creates a folder with a given name, a basic `.c/.cpp` file with the same given name, and also a makefile to compile. Finally the script open `vim` to edit your file and start coding.
